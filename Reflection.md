# Reflection on Resume Assignment

## Can I explain what my code does?
Yes, my code structures a personal resume as a webpage using HTML for content and CSS for styling. The HTML includes sections for personal information, objectives, experience, education, and skills. The CSS applies a cohesive color scheme, custom fonts, and responsive design elements.

## What was my coding process?
I began by planning the layout and content structure. I created a wireframe to visualize how the sections would be organized. I then wrote the HTML to structure the content before moving on to the CSS for styling. I utilized Flexbox for layout adjustments and made sure the design was responsive by using media queries.

## What challenges did I have?
One challenge was ensuring the website was fully responsive. I had to experiment with different Flexbox configurations and media queries to achieve the desired layout on various devices. Additionally, I had to consider accessibility aspects, such as color contrast and link visibility.

## What would I do differently now?
If I were to start over, I would allocate more time for testing across different devices and browsers to catch any issues earlier. I would also explore additional CSS features like animations to enhance interactivity.
